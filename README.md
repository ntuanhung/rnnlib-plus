# RNNLIB-plus
## Origin
The original RNNLIB is hosted at [http://sourceforge.net/projects/rnnl](http://sourceforge.net/projects/rnnl) from 2012.
During my master and Ph.D. time, I work with RNNLIB for online handwriting recognition. 
I am appreciate Alex Graves for availing RNNLIB under GNU v3, which helps me to understand RNN and LSTM much better. 

However, over 5 years without maintainance, there are several bugs during compiling or executing the origin RNNLIB 
on new OS versions, as well as new libraries such as *boost*, *netcdf*, and so on.

Therefore, this repository is created to update RNNLIB with clear documentations, updates and fixed bugs.
I also provide some new utilities such as progress bar, Visual Studio version and so on.
Moreover, I will write a tutorials for using RNNLIB in real situations.

## Contents
- [Visual Studio version]()
- [Update source code]()
- [Fixed bugs]()
- [Insert progress bar utility]().

## Contact
If you found out any problem from the original version or my version,
